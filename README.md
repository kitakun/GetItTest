### "Get It" Test Application

#### For Database Initialization:

* First you need to change config in <code>./Voronov.GetItTestApp.Persistnce.EntityFramework/DbConfig.json</code> file.
This is how it's going to look:
    ```json
    {
        "DatabaseName": "temp",
        "ServerUrl": "localhost",
        "ServerPort": 5432,
        "UserName": "postgres",
        "Password": "admin"
    }
    ```
* After setting Database configuration in root folder you need to find a file named `init.bat`, after the launching of the file the project will be compiled and then Initial Migration will start.

#### For client react application:

For building client application you need to:
Execute `npm install` and `npm run build` in `Voronov.GetItTestApp.Web\ClientApp` folder
Also, the same action will be done with VisualStudio solution project

#### The next frameworks were used for developing the Application:
* .NET Core 2.1
* PostgreSQL 11.0
* Entity Framework
* React 16.7 (redux some times)
* Typescript as language for react application

#### What can be done better?

* Application doesn't have notification, so sometimes user can't see error (e.g. login with incorrect user name)
* Predefined database data has negative Id's, because 'ef' hasData method has incorrect inserting behaviour.
Autogenerated properties will be forced to start from id 1 ignoring any existing data.
* Missed 'create new user' page
